CBA has been introduced in 2012 as a hackathon project. Since 2015 it didn't
have any major updates, mostly because of the complicated monolith architecture
and the only maintainer being busy developing ([Adblock
Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)). Now things are going to change, as the whole
project has been rewritten in 2020 and more people have got involved in the
project development. We today are starting the Beta testing phase of the CBA
complete rewrite. CBA will become a community driven project that will help itâ€™s
users become more productive and work smart. In order to move the project
forward we need your input and wish to see you as one of the driving force of
the new CBA.

In order to help us with Beta testing phase, planing and development please
