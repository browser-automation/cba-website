## Need to fallback to the old verions?

In case you really need to fallback to the v8 you can do that following
[installing CBA 8.3.7 instructions on the current
page](/new_8#installing-cba-8.3.7).

## Having issue automating kiss-kiss game?

After releasing version 9.0 a lot of CBA users have reported an automation
script being broken which they used for automating Kiss Kiss game. Aparently
someone from the game community have created script a while ago which is no more
compatible with CBA v9.0. Luckily [a new script is ready to
use](https://chrome-automation.com/kisskiss) we are still working on it, so in
case you notice something unexpected or want to improve please do not hessitate
contacting me at [saroyanm@gmail.com](mailto:saroyanm@gmail.com).
