CBA has been created in 2012 as a hackathon project. Since then it only had few
changes and poor maintainability, while it was just a hobby project. After
almost 10 years things are going to change, as the whole project has been
rewritten in 2020, we today are starting the Beta testing phase for CBA. CBA
won’t be a hobby project that is barely being maintained, but it will become a
community driven project that will help it’s users become more productive and
work smart. In order to move the project forward we need your input and wish to
see you as one of the driving force of the new CBA.
