After releasing [version 9.0](/new_9-0) a lot of CBA users have reported an
automation script being broken which they used for automating Kiss Kiss game.
Aparently someone from the game community have created a script while ago which
is no more compatible with CBA v9.0. Luckily a new script is ready to use.

## Installing new kiss kiss game automation project
### Step 1: Copy new automation code from <a href="https://chrome-automation.com/kisskiss.txt" target="_blank">chrome-automation.com/kisskiss.txt</a>
