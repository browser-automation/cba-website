The action that Pause project workflow, it could be useful if you want to fill some forms manually and then continue with project workflow. 

When the project workflow reaches that action, play button changes name to "resume" and text under extension icon changes to "||", so the project will wait for your actions to continue workflow, so anytime you can click on stop button and the extension will go back to freeze mode and will wait for your actions. 

After manual interaction you can click "resume" button and project will continue it's workflow.
