Copy action uses the Jquery selector to get content of the element and save it to the clipboard\["copy"\] object. Here is a reference to [clipboard object](/clipboard). For [Change action](/change) you can use `<$clipboard=copy>` placeholder to change element value with `clipboard["copy"]` one. ![](/images/copy.jpg) ![](/imagesclipboard-past.jpg)
