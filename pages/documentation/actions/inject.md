## Important

Starting from version 8 **inject** action is different from the one CBA used in version 7. In version 7, CBA used **inject** action to inject script into content script that were providing you only access to web page DOM, now the action provide you ability to inject the code directly into the web page. to inject code into content script please use [cs-inject](/inject-cs) from now.
