### Short
Never execute a snippet that was provided by an untrusted source.

### Longer

With great power comes great responsibility. CBA provides ability to automate
quite a lot of annoying and repetitive tasks, but as in case of any powerful
tool the power can be missused. As the CBA is user centric product it's our
responsibility to keep our users secure and aware. Most of the actions in the
CBA provide only limited access to what can be done, mostly it's about
manipulating inputs, but actions like [inject](/inject), [bg-inject](/bg-inject)
and [cs-inject](/inject-cs) are capable of doing not only this, as those gives
you access to the full capabilities of automating Chrome browser through code
injections.

The most important precaution you should take is to ensure that you trust the
code you are executing, never execute a snippet that was provided by an
untrusted source.

If you are in control of the actions and using trusted snippets, you don't have
to be worried about anything, just enjoy your powerful capabilities and be
creative in what you are creating.

At CBA we are not aware of such actions beeing taken previously, but it's our
responsibility to inform you in advance to keep our users safe.
