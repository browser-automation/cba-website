title: Actions datagrid
---
Actions are portions of code that are injected one by one,  you can add action, delete, edit and save after editing using the buttons below the textarea, also you can manage them via DragNDrop and highlight page’s element after rolling mouse over on the actions datagrid row. You can use that highlight option for (change, click, click-submit and check) action’s events. So It’ll be helpful for example to check if the selector is correct.
