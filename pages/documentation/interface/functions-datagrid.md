You can use helpfull and growing CBA functions. Just Drag and Drop functions to Actions data grid and CBA will calls the function when actions workflow will reach that function .For example here you can see some of that functions, for example FB Likes which likes all posts in facebook opened area or you can modify it for example to like posts of individual facebook user. Same for FB Unlike and also you can for example use Add Friend function which will click all “add friends” facebook buttons in opened area.
