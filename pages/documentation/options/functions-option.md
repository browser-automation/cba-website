In this section you can create ready functions which you can use in functions interface - just drag and drop the function to actions table to use already ready script in the project.

You can find ready functions in the functions section of the documentation.

If you created some cool function I'll ask you to send it to me using mail form, or write to me [directly](mailto:saroyanm@gmail.com?Subject=From%20CBA%20user) and after manuall review of the function it could be possible that the function will appear in functions section and will be available to everyone.

To create CBA function you need to:

- Define function name
- write script in script section
- and choose action type
