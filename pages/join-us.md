## What and why

CBA was one of the first chrome extensions that allowed itâ€™s users to boost
their productivity. The development has been stopped from 2015-2019, as the main
maintainter was busy developing Adblock Plus.

Things have changed in 2020, when CBA has been finally rewritten, open sourced
and now we are looking for a frontend engineer to help us with the development
of a complete new UI for CBA and revolutionizing the recording of automation. So
in case you would like to join us on this early stage I think it will be a great
opportunity for you to work on a project which will change how automations are
being created, develop a community around it and partner with us to be one of
the first people on board on this early stage.

Why we think CBA can be successful -> CBA has **more than 43 000 weekly** users
and **more than 250 000 downloads**, since last month announcement of open
sourcing the project, it made to front page of Hacker News and brought 35+
stargazers, we are going to multiply numbers quite drastically and make CBA one
of the type automation tool.
